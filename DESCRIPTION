Description: The analysis of high-resolution melting (HRM) curves provides cost-efficient post-PCR distinction among amplicons differing by as little as a single base pair, based on their thermal denaturation (melting) properties. HRM curve analysis has been used mainly for genotyping and detection of mutations. Beside genotyping, the method has been used to differentiate viral, bacterial and fungal pathogens, and it has a potential for plant genotyping in breeding and as an alternative to DNA barcoding for taxonomic assignment of species. This package offers functions that facilitate drawing denaturation, melting, and difference curves in HRM curve analysis in R.
